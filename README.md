# veddit
> a simplistic reddit wrapper for V

### usage:
a few simplistic applications can be found in [the examples folder](./examples),


logging a user's about details is also very easy, and can be seen here:
```v
module main

import acelikesghosts.veddit

fn main() {
    about := veddit.about_user('acelikesaudio')!
    // about.whatever
    println('id: ${about.data.id}')

    // to get a user's posts, use the veddit.user_posts_a method
    posts := veddit.user_posts_a('acelikesaudio')!

    // for each child in the data's children
    // or, for each post in the array of posts (children)
    for child in posts.data.children {
        println('"${child.data.title}" at ${child.data.created_utc} UTC (${child.data.permalink})')
    }
}
```
